# Neural Network
A CNN that solves the MNIST challenge
The code here works on tensorflow backend an makes use of the standard Keras library to:
  a.) Import the datset
  b.) Import the classifier
  c.) Make the CNN and add layers to it.
Rest I have made the code to run on 2 epochs and got a 95%+ accuracy.
